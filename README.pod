This is an attempt to create a meta compiler using the syntax from bnfc
and or OMeta.

The idea is to use a simple perl program bootstrap which can read a basic
file and create an AST from it.

The next phase will be to create an interpreter that can be rebuild
from a grammar file.

Then the idea is to write a more advanced version in our new language.
The perl bootstrap will take the input file and generate an interpreter

Then we can start building it up and experimenting with adding things.

Right now this is just a bunch of unorganized junk.
lbnf.bnf		bnf for bnfc's grammar
basic_types.bnf		some defaults that were not included in lbnf.bnf
calc.om			Ometa simple calculator
perl6			directory with some perl6 experiments
bootstrap.pl		Use regex's to read in lbnf.bnf
doit.sw			Start of a backend in sweet(lpc/pike)
